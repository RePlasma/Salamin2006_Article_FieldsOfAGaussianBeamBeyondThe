Abstract: Analytic expressions for the fields of a tightly focused Gaussian laser beam are derived, accurate to ε11, where ε is the diffraction angle. It is found that, for example, using the derived fields, the calculated power can be about 25% more accurate than when calculated using the paraxial approximation for a beam focused down to a waist radius w0∼0.4λ, where λ is the wavelength.
